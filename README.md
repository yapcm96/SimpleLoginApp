A simple login app built in Kotlin.

To login after launching the app, enter "yapcm96" for username and "1234" for password. 

The app demonstrates a few things:
- Login Validation
  - When the login button is pressed while the fields are empty, a Toast message will display to ask user to please fill all the fields.
  - Similarly, if the credentials are incorrect a Toast message will display to say the credentials are incorrect.

- ListView
  - A simple listview to display hardcoded information on successful login (login button navigates to a new activity)
